# Hi, I'm Ashikur 👋🏾 👩🏾‍💻

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/developerashikur1/developerashikur1/main/developerashikur1.png" alt="banner that says Ashikur Rahman - full-stack developer">
I'm a full-stack developer who is passionate about making contributing to open-source more approachable, creating applications to elevate people, and building community. Some technologies I enjoy working with include ReactJS, NextJS (JavaScript, APIs + Markup), and NodeJS. My interest in the React ecosystem led me to launch <a href="#">React Robins</a>, a community for ReactJS developers.
