I'm a full-stack developer who is passionate about making contributing to open-source more approachable, creating applications to elevate people, and building community. Some technologies I enjoy working with include ReactJS, NextJS (JavaScript, APIs + Markup), and NodeJS. My interest in the React ecosystem led me to launch <a href="#">A 3R</a>, a community for ReactJS developers.
